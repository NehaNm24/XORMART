<H4>Spieces of India.</H4>
<P>Whole spices are generously added to every Indian dish and only these magical whole spices impart a unique and earthy flavour to them. The use of Indian whole spices makes our cuisine acquisitive and different from the rest of the cuisines. Mustard is known as a medicinal and culinary spice since ages in India. Mustard is lavishly used as a seasoning in many dishes but along with all this mustard has antiseptic, warming, carminative, antibacterial, and antiviral properties.</P>
